# Artificial Intelligence impact in Healthcare

## INTRODUCTION TO AI:
Artificial intelligence has been improving quite a lot in recent years. Its technological and sophisticated tools have replaced human labor as they save time and money, and also are more effective. AI and robotics, like any other aspect of life, are having a significant impact on healthcare and medicine. Many jobs in healthcare departments, such as information and data collection, which is now almost entirely digital, are already being replaced by AI and robotics. AI is also being used to aid in the early detection of rare diseases such as cancer and other blood disorders. In turn, virtual healthcare assistants are also being widely used around the world, especially since the 2019 pandemic began.

Artificial intelligence is gradually revolutionizing the way that healthcare is delivered. It has the potential to ease accessing to healthcare services, ensure better clinical workflows and patient experiences, and increase the efficiency and speed in medical care delivery, which lead to more improved and desirable results and outcomes (McKinsey, 2020). 
AI is helping clinicians make better decisions and enhance operational efficiency, ultimately increasing the influence of every clinical practitioner. AI has an enormous impact in healthcare. It is gradually becoming one of the most important components of healthcare system all around the world, just as they already are part of our daily routines. Artificial Intelligence may assure a speedier wrap period as well as an optimal functioning, from delivering personal attention to patients to simplifying the drug manufacturing process (Market Trends, March 2022). Furthermore, following will be discussed about the most important ways that AI is boosting and changing the healthcare industry.

## WAYS AI IS IMPROVING HEALTHCARE:
Some of the most important changes and improvements that AI has done in the healthcare departments are:

#### 1.	Well-keeping and assisting patients/medical practitioners:

One of the major and most significant potential applications of artificial intelligence is that it helps people maintain their balanced lifestyle and well-being, in such a way so they adopt healthy behaviors by using technology programs, like they already are having plenty benefits from the usage of AI in public health apps. 
AI is also being used to assist people in their daily activities, by accomplishing a variety of tasks that humans can do. Here we can mention robotics, which are intended to serve as personal patient’s helpers. They can participate in dialogues with the patient, telling them to examine their well-being regularly, like monitoring the blood pressure and glucose levels, also reminding their medication times etc (Analytics Insight, 2022).
On the other hand, in relation to the clinical staffs, there are certain medical robots, which assist patients. *Exoskeleton robots*, for example, can assist paralyzed individuals to get back to walking, in this way resuming their independence from their caretakers (Marius E., May 2019).

#### 2.	Early diagnosis and disease detection:

The true strength of AI resides in detecting and recognizing patterns that explain diverse illnesses by researching healthcare records and many other information. The machines can examine thousands of cases and hunt for correlations among lots of elements, some of which aren't even mentioned in current medical literature (Wang, F., & Preininger, A.,2019).
Tests have shown that AI and robotics can compete and also outperform the greatest doctors. So far, one of the biggest problems in healthcare departments  still is cancer diagnosis. For example, a new technology is developed recently, a Japanese endoscopic device, which is around 86% accurate in diagnosing colon cancer at early phases in real-time (Marius E., May 2019).
AI promises to make huge advancements in qualitative explanation of cancer imaging, including the prediction of the clinical results, and the evaluation of the influence of the disease (Hosny A., Schabath M.,  March 2019).

#### 3.	AI contributes to cancer research and treatment
The most important point we can mention in cancer treatment is definitely radiation therapy. But, radiation therapy may lack some computerized databases to gather and manage electronic health records in some circumstances, making cancer treatment way more challenging.
However, lately, a new framework was developed from Oncora Medical. A framework that would help clinical practitioners make better decisions, from gathering information about radiation therapy for people who are dealing with cancer. This platform collects the neccesary medical information from patients with cancer, analyzes the quality of the delivered care to the patients, it makes more personalized treatments for each of the patients, and it also offers comprehensive oncology performances, results, information, as well as image processing (Liz Kwo, July 2021).
This new computerized development of the clinical documentations connected with HER reduces the time that medical practitioners spend in monitoring patient data, improves the medical procedures and also the reoults and outcomes are more desirable. 

#### 4.	Cybersecurity
The incorporation of AI in the systems of cyber security can assist in reducing the ever-increasing cyber security risk confronting most of global departments and companies. Through artificial intelligence, that kind of data threat may be shrunk down in a relatively short period of time, in this way allowing the companies to recognize and respond to a safety problem.
AI is now getting applied in a lot of categories of cyber security systems and solutions. For example, AI technology already is implemented in Gmail, to detect and prevent the unwanted stolen emails (Welukar J., Bajoria G., 2021).
AI is also used in healthcare cybersecurity departments. For example, EHR – Electronic Health Records, is AI technoogy system, which is implemented in saving patients personal and medical information, and taking care that no 3rd part has access to those data. 

## THE FUTURE OF AI IN HEALTHCARE:
In recent years, there has been a huge growth in the development and activities that are connected to AI in healthcare departments, including here the integrating various parts of clinical information, and also creating links between drugs research, development and clinical data.
Furthermore about the clinical data, patient-related data and information, day-by-day is becoming increasingly important. Information that can be edited and generated quite easily by just some wearables (AppleWatch etc.) or mobile phones (Wang F., Preininger A., 2019).
As it belongs to the future of AI in healthcare, we are not able to determine exactly how AI will progress. However, there are three different developing stages are beginning to appear already. 
The first stage is more of short-term, where AI is expected to come with image understanding, helping people with chronic diseases to manage their conditions more independently(Vlachos S., 2020). 
In the midterm stage we wait to notice more solutions in the clinical setting workflows. These solutions will assist the transition of healthcare delivery from clinic-based to a digital one, as well as additional different healthcare apps, such as medical notetaking apps, reminders,  that assist people in taking better control of their wellbeing (Monique Van Dijk, 2020).
Third stage includes improved information management, such as the patient’s proper perspective. These will be helping to generate an expanded “Digital-twin” of the person, device this, that will be assisting in determining on the ideal therapy result for each patient specially. During this stage, AI is expected to also possibly aid to predict the chances of getting or developing a new health condition or disease (Hofstraat H., Philips Chief Technology Office, 2020).
