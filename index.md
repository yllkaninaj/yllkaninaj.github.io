Artificial Intelligence impact in Healthcare

INTRODUCTION TO AI:
Artificial intelligence has been improving quite a lot in recent years. Its technological and sophisticated tools have replaced human labor as they save time and money, and also are more effective. AI and robotics, like any other aspect of life, are having a significant impact on healthcare and medicine. Many jobs in healthcare departments, such as information and data collection, which is now almost entirely digital, are already being replaced by AI and robotics. AI is also being used to aid in the early detection of rare diseases such as cancer and other blood disorders. In turn, virtual healthcare assistants are also being widely used around the world, especially since the 2019 pandemic began.
